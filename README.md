Project Description: 

The aim of the project was to show the design and development of smart green environment of garbage monitoring system by measuring the garbage level in real time. The proposed system consisted the ultrasonic sensors which measure the garbage level, LPC 1768 which controls system operation and send the data to ThingSpeak application which represent the amount of trash in the bin. This work demonstrates a system that allows the waste management to monitor based on the level of the garbage depth inside the dustbin. This process indicates the bins that require attention and use can optimize the garbage collection route and ultimately reduce the fuel consumption. It allows management as well as trash collector to set their pickup schedule accordingly. Cost of the product development ranges between $300-$350.

The detailed procedure and methodology of our project is as below:

1.	Attach Ultrasonic sensors to on the top of the dustbin.
2.	LPC 1768 is connected to ultrasonic sensors to monitor the actual trash.
3.	Interface LCD with LPC 1768 to shows the garbage level in percent level.
4.	Connect ESP 8266 to the LPC 1768 to send the data over wi-fi to get the garbage level on ThingSpeak.
5.	Interface GSM module with LPC 1768 to get the text notification via SIM800L module.
